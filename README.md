## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains a researched open letter written for an ENG 111 assignment at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA).  
A standard English assignment was transformed into a **professional cybersecurity research project** addressing real vulnerabilities affecting college students.

The letter analyzes cybersecurity risks students face and proposes actionable solutions NOVA can implement immediately.

---

## 🛡 Problem Summary
College students are one of the most common targets for cybercriminals due to:

- Weak or reused passwords  
- Unsafe public Wi-Fi usage  
- Poor phishing detection  
- Limited cybersecurity education  
- High reliance on digital platforms  

These lead to identity theft, financial fraud, academic account compromise, and long-term credit damage.

---

## 🎓 Purpose of This Project
The goal is to persuade NOVA administrators — specifically the **IT Department** and **Office of Student Affairs** — to implement:

1. **Mandatory Cybersecurity Awareness Training**
2. **Continuous Cybersecurity Initiatives**

Both solutions are supported by credible peer-reviewed research.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solutions

### **1. Required Cybersecurity Course for First-Year Students**
A semester course covering:
- Phishing identification  
- Password hygiene  
- MFA  
- Device updates  
- Safe network usage  

### **2. Ongoing Cybersecurity Awareness**
- Monthly newsletters  
- Scam alerts  
- Update reminders  
- Interactive workshops  

These improve digital safety campus-wide.
