## Armas, R., et al. “Building a Cybersecurity Culture in Higher Education.” *Information*, vol. 16, no. 5, 2025, pp. 1–15. MDPI, https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/16/5/336.

**Summary:**  
This peer-reviewed article explores how colleges can strengthen digital safety by creating a cybersecurity-focused culture across their campuses. The authors identify the most common weaknesses among students and faculty, including weak passwords, low phishing awareness, and the misconception that cybersecurity is solely the responsibility of the IT department. The article emphasizes that early education—such as required cybersecurity courses and mandatory training during orientation—significantly improves overall cybersecurity hygiene. Case studies from multiple universities show that consistent education, regular awareness initiatives, and long-term engagement are key to strengthening cybersecurity in higher education.

**Evaluation:**  
The source is credible, recent, and backed by data-driven research from cybersecurity professionals. The article was published in 2025 and remains highly relevant due to the continued rise of phishing and identity theft. Although the authors focus heavily on analysis and solutions, the research remains objective and informative. This source directly supports the argument that implementing structured cybersecurity training at NOVA would reduce student vulnerabilities and promote long-term digital safety.

## Hobbs, James. “Cybersecurity Awareness in Higher Education: Understanding Student Knowledge Gaps.” *Issues in Information Systems*, vol. 24, no. 1, 2023, pp. 159–169. IACIS, https://iacis.org/iis/2023/1_iis_2023_159-169.pdf.

**Summary:**  
Hobbs analyzes the gap between students’ perceived cybersecurity knowledge and their actual understanding of digital safety practices. Surveys conducted at multiple universities reveal that even students who believe they are tech-savvy often fail to recognize phishing attempts, use weak or repeated passwords, and regularly connect to unsecured public Wi-Fi. These behaviors create ideal opportunities for cybercriminals to steal credentials, access personal data, and commit financial fraud. The article concludes that colleges must incorporate structured cybersecurity training to help students identify threats more effectively and build stronger online safety habits.

**Evaluation:**  
This source is credible, objective, and supported by real survey data. Despite being published in 2023, the cybersecurity challenges described remain highly relevant due to the rise of phishing, scams, and identity theft targeting students. Hobbs presents the information without bias, focusing strictly on research findings. This study will be used to support the argument that students lack essential cybersecurity knowledge and that NOVA must implement required training to reduce these vulnerabilities.
